            <p id="TextoC"> The <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">software development process</a>
                is a structure applied to the development of a product
                of software
                There are several role models for establishing a process for software development, each
                one of which
                It describes a different approach to different activities that take place during the process. There is
                various development processes of
                specific software that fit a life cycle model. The activities will depend on the model
                to choose. <br> <a style="color: rgb(24, 126, 250);font-weight: bold;">Models:</a> <br>
                <br><a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Cascada:</a> The development in Cascada is
                the methodological approach that rigorously orders the stages of
                software development process so that each start of a stage must wait for the
                completion of the previous one. <br>
                <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Spiral:</a> Spiral development is a software
                life cycle model defined by Barry Boehm.
                The activities of the spiral model
                they are not fixed but are chosen based on the risk analysis starting with the loop
                interior. <br>
                <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Prototype model:</a> The prototype model
                belongs to the evolutionary development models. The prototype must be built
                in a short time using the right programs and you should not use many resources. <br>
                <br><a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;"> Rapid application development:</a>Rapid
                application development or also known RAD is a process
                initially developed by James Martin. Today it is often used to refer to the rapid development of
                graphical user interfaces <br>
                <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Iterative model:</a> It is a model derived
                from the cascade life cycle. This model seeks to reduce the risk that arises between the needs of the
                user and the
                final product due to misunderstandings during the requirements collection stage. <br>
                <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Extreme Programming:</a> It is an agile and
                flexible methodology used for project management. It focuses on empowering
                The interpersonal relationships of the development team as a key to success through teamwork.</p>
