                   <p id="TextoC"> The software development <a style="color:rgb(65, 149, 253); font-weight: bold;">process</a> is a structure applied to the development of a product
                        of software
                        There are several role models for establishing a process for software development, each
                        one of which
                        It describes a different approach to different activities that take place during the process. There is
                        various development processes of
                        specific software that fit a life cycle model. The activities will depend on the model
                        to choose. <br> Models: <br>
                        Cascada: The development in Cascada is the methodological approach that rigorously orders the stages of
                        software development process so that each start of a stage must wait for the
                        completion of the previous one. <br>
                        <br> Spiral: Spiral development is a software life cycle model defined by Barry Boehm.
                        The activities of the spiral model
                        they are not fixed but are chosen based on the risk analysis starting with the loop
                        interior. <br>
                        <br> Prototype model: The prototype model belongs to the evolutionary development models. The prototype must be built
                        in a short time using the right programs and you should not use many resources. <br>
                        <br> Rapid application development: Rapid application development or also known RAD is a process
                        initially developed by James Martin. Today it is often used to refer to the rapid development of graphical user interfaces <br>
                        <br> Iterative model: It is a model derived from the cascade life cycle. This model seeks to reduce the risk that arises between the needs of the user and the
                        final product due to misunderstandings during the requirements collection stage. <br>
                        <br> Extreme Programming: It is an agile and flexible methodology used for project management. It focuses on empowering
                        The interpersonal relationships of the development team as a key to success through teamwork.</p></div>
