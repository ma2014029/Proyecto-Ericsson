            <p id="TextoC"> We are in an era of automation everywhere!
                we are entering a generation in which there will be applications developed specifically for
                The work is done easily and efficiently. For that there are the <a
                    style="color:rgb(65, 149, 253); font-weight: bold;">tools</a> for testing
                software are tools made for, as the name indicates automated software testing, and
                also the
                software development tools, in itself it is a computer program that uses a computer program
                to create,
                debug it, manage or maintain a program. <br> In the tools for testep are: SoapUi,
                Postman,
                Jmeter
                <br> In the tools for development are: make, Jtest, Javadoc <br>
                Some examples are: <br>
                SoapUi: It is a tool developed in java for testing applications with

                <br> Postman: It is a tool when you try to dissect RESTful API, made by others or try the ones you have
                done yourself.
                It offers an elegant user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a
                lot of code
                just to propagate functionality in an API. With Postman such a test is much more simplified. <br>
                <br> Selenium: It is a software testing environment for web-based applications. Selenium provides a burn
                / replay tool
                to create tests without using a scripting language for tests.
                <br> Ranorex: Key features and benefits of the Ranorex test automation solution.<br>
                Katalon Studio:Katalon Studio is a powerful and comprehensive automation solution for testing API, Web,
                mobile, and desktop application testing. It also has a rich feature set for these types of testing and

                <br>UFT:UFT is a popular commercial tool to test desktop, Web, and mobile application. It has been
                extended to include a good set of capabilities for API testing. By supporting multiple platforms for the
                target application under test (AUT), UFT provides a convenient choice to test the AUT that operates on
                desktop, Web, and mobile.
