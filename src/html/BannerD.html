            <p id="TextoC"> A <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Developer</a> is a person who is
                dedicated to one or more
                aspects of the software development process. It is a very broad area of
                algorithmic programming. In informatics a developer is a computer specialist who is able to conceive and
                Develop computer systems. As time passes, the separation between the design of computer systems, the
                development of
                software, and programming, are becoming clearer and differentiated. In the labor market usually
                find a differentiation between programmers and developers, the latter being the ones who
                design the structure or hierarchy of classes.
                To respond adequately and in the best way to the client's needs, it is convenient that in a
                First stage the developer establishes a "load notebook", in order to determine and
                specify the needs of the client in terms of automation, computerization, and control,
                subject by subject. At this stage, the following issues should be clarified:

                <br> Regarding computerization, it will be useful to clarify its advantages, since there are cases in
                the
                that things can become more efficient and with better economic results without
                computerization than with her. This issue is crucial and fundamental, and should be analyzed with
                long-range vision, because what is generally about, is to conceive a computer system
                To accompany the client in his future evolution during the next years.
                <br> This is a crucial phase since it is not only necessary to respond to the current needs of the
                client, but also design a computer system that will accompany the client in the evolution of
                Your activities.

                <br> In a second stage a technical solution (<a
                    style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Hardware</a>) is developed and a model is
                created (analysis
                organic) of the future software (<a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">software</a>)
                that will manage the future computer system (if not
                exists).

                <br> Then you should write the lines of code necessary for proper operation
                (<a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">programming</a>), participate in the testing
                phases, prepare the technical documentation, and do
                Product monitoring and maintenance.

                <br> The developer can also train users.

                <br> His main responsibilities are:

                <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Team work:</a> the team works for the
                realization of the application that corresponds to the
                customer needs.</p>
