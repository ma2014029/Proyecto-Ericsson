                        to the interested party or stakeholder. <br> It is one more activity in the quality control process.
                        <br> Testing is basically a set of activities within software development.
                        <br> Depending on the type of tests, these activities may be implemented in any
                        moment of said development process. <br> There are different software development models, as well as test models.
                        <br> Each one corresponds to a different level of involvement in the activities of
                        developing. For this there are the "testers", a tester investigates a software product with the objective
                        To obtain information about its quality and the value represented by those who use it, the tester participates in
                        all stages of the development of a software collaborating to ensure the highest quality of the product.
                        <br> There are different testing methods such as: <br>
                        <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">Black Box:</a> This is the software test method used to test the software without knowing the internal structure of its code.
                        <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">White Box:</a> These techniques are performed when the tester accesses the source code of the application and consequently the different algorithms and data structures used.
                        <br><a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;"> Gray Box: </a> simple gray box concept is based on the black box relationship based on test cases, made by people who know the program inside.
                        The gray box is a test hybrid of Black Box and White Box.
                        <br> <a style="color: rgb(65, 149, 253);font-weight: bold;">GUI Testing:</a> Currently the graphical user interface is usually one of the parts of a software project that is tested less completely and less systematically
