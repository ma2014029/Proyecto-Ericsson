    <p class="lead">A developer is a person who is dedicated to one or more aspects of the software development process.
        It is a very broad area of algorithmic programming. In informatics a developer is a computer specialist who is
        able to conceive and Develop computer systems. As time passes, the separation between the design of computer
        systems, the development of software, and programming, are becoming clearer and differentiated. In the labor
        market usually find a differentiation between programmers and developers, the latter being the ones who design
        the structure or hierarchy of classes.To respond adequately and in the best way to the client's needs, it is
        convenient that in a First stage the developer establishes a "load notebook", in order to determine and specify
        the needs of the client in terms of automation, computerization, and control, subject by subject. At this stage,
        the following issues should be clarified:

                    <br> Regarding computerization, it will be useful to clarify its advantages, since there are cases in the that things can become more efficient and with better economic results without                   computerization than with her. This issue is crucial and fundamental, and should be analyzed with                   long-range vision, because what is generally about, is to conceive a computer system
                    To accompany the client in his future evolution during the next years.<br> This is a crucial phase since it is not only necessary to respond to the current needs of the
                    client, but also design a computer system that will accompany the client in the evolution of
                    Your activities.

                    <br> In a second stage a technical solution (Hardware) is developed and a model is created (analysis
                    organic) of the future software (software) that will manage the future computer system (if not
                    exists).

                    <br> Then you should write the lines of code necessary for proper operation
                    (programming), participate in the testing phases, prepare the technical documentation, and do
                    Product monitoring and maintenance.

                    <br> The developer can also train users.

                    <br> His main responsibilities are:

                    <br> Team work: the team works for the realization of the application that corresponds to the
                    customer needs.
